	<h1>Hello, I'm Sonali Joshi.</h1>
	<h2>Welcome to my world.</h2>
	<p> I am a programmer and a computational biologist, with 4 years of experience in the IT industry working on customizing ERP solutions, online stock trading systems and training users. <br>
	It involved extensive programming in C, C++ and Oracle databases.
	
	<br>After a hiatus of several years raising my kids, I am looking towards restarting my career in Bioinformatics.
	To that end, I completed a Genomic Data Science certification on Coursera. Last year I worked on a short term project at UCLA doing post-GWAS data analysis which led to the publication of two papers.

	<h2>In my free time...</h2>
	<p>I volunteer as a Girl Scout troop leader. I mentor girls and lead them on adventures.
	<br>Read about my <a href="GirlScouts.html">troop's latest project</a> as published in the November issue of the local newspaper, The Santa Monica Star.</p>
