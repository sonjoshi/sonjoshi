	<h3>Hello, you have reached the webpage of Sonali Joshi.</h3>
	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<p> I am a programmer and a computational biologist. I have 4 years of experience 
	in the IT industry working on customizing ERP solutions and online stock trading systems, which involved extensive programming 
	in C, C++ and Oracle databases.
	
	I have a Master's degree in Computational Biology where I studied theoretical population genetics and bioinformatics among other things.
	<br>After a hiatus of several years raising my kids, I am looking forward to restarting my career in Bioinformatics.
	To that end, I completed a Genomic Data Science certification on Coursera. Last year, I worked on a short term project at UCLA doing post-GWAS data analysis which led to the publication of two papers.

	<h5> Python </h5> <p> I wrote a few quick <a href="https://github.com/sonjoshi/GWASdata"> Python</a> programs to help process large GWAS text files that were too big to open in Excel.
	<h5> R </h5> <p><a href="https://github.com/sonjoshi/DataScientistToolbox"> R markdown files</a> from various projects on Coursera.
	<h5> Cytoscape </h5> <p><a href="https://github.com/sonjoshi/CytoscapeVisualizations">Cytoscape</a> network visualizations showing the pathways from the post GWAS analysis.

	<h3>In my free time...</h3>
	<p>I volunteer as a Girl Scout troop leader. I mentor girls and lead them on adventures.
	<br>Read about my <a href="GirlScouts.html">troop's latest project</a> as published in the November issue of the local newspaper, The Santa Monica Star.</p>

	
	<p>I also enjoy Geocaching with my family, gardening and listening to podcasts.
